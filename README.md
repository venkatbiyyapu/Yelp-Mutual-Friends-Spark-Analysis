# Yelp & Mutual Friends Analysis Using Apache Spark on Databricks

## Overview

This project consists of two major parts: 
1. **Yelp Dataset Analysis**: Analyzing user reviews, businesses, and ratings from Yelp data using Apache Spark.
2. **Mutual Friends Analysis**: Finding common friends between pairs of users and additional mutual friend-based insights.

### Key Tasks:
1. **Mutual Friends Calculation**: For each friend pair, calculate the number of common friends.
2. **Identifying Friend Pairs Below Median**: Find pairs whose mutual friend count is below the median.
3. **Yelp User and Business Analysis**: Extract insights from Yelpâ€™s dataset, including average user ratings for Pittsburgh businesses, top-rated businesses, top contributing users, and more.

## Datasets

### Mutual Friends Dataset:
1. **mutual.txt**: Contains the user and their friends in an adjacency list format. Each user is listed with their friends.
    ```
    <User> <TAB> <Friends>
    ```
    - Example:
        ```
        Alice    Bob,Sam,Sara,Nancy
        Bob      Alice,Sam,Clara,Nancy
        ```

### Yelp Dataset:
1. **business.csv**: Contains information about local businesses, including business ID, full address, and categories.

## Part 1: Mutual Friends Analysis

### Task 1: Finding Common Friends for Friend Pairs

**Problem Statement**: Given the adjacency list in `mutual.txt`, compute the number of mutual friends for each pair of friends. 
**Script**: mutual_friends_analysis.py
**Input**: 
- **mutual.txt**: A list of users and their friends. Each line represents a user and their friends.

**Output**:
- Each line represents a friend pair and the number of common friends between them.
    ```
    <User_A>, <User_B> <TAB> <Mutual/Common Friend Number>
    ```
    - Example:
        ```
        Alice, Bob    2
        ```

**Steps**:
1. Parse the input to extract each user and their list of friends.
2. For each pair of friends, compute their common friends.
3. Output the pairs with their mutual friend count.

### Task 2: Identifying Pairs with Fewer Common Friends than the Median

**Problem Statement**: From the friend pairs and mutual friend count calculated in Task 1, find pairs with a mutual friend count below the median.
**Script**: mutual_friends_below_median.py
**Input**: 
- **mutual.txt** (same as Task 1).

**Output**:
- Pairs whose mutual friend count is lower than the median.
    ```
    <User_A>, <User_B> <TAB> <Mutual/Common Friend Number>
    ```

**Steps**:
1. Compute mutual friend counts for each pair (from Task 1).
2. Find the median of the mutual friend counts.
3. Filter and output pairs whose mutual friend count is below the median.

**Steps**:
1. Filter `business.csv` for businesses in Pittsburgh.
2. Join the Pittsburgh businesses with `review.csv` to get user reviews for those businesses.
3. Join the result with `user.csv` to get user names.
4. Calculate the average rating per user and output the result.

### Task 4: Top 10 Businesses by Average Rating

**Problem Statement**: Find the top 10 businesses by their average rating.
**Script**: pittsburgh_user_ratings.py

    ```

**Steps**:
1. Calculate the average rating for each business using `review.csv`.
2. Join with `business.csv` to get business details and categories.
3. Output the top 10 businesses based on average rating.

### Task 5: Top 10 Users by Contribution to Reviews

**Problem Statement**: Identify the top 10 users who contributed the most reviews as a percentage of total reviews.

## Running the Project on Databricks

To run this project on Databricks, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Databricks Workspace**: Set up an account and create a Databricks workspace if you haven't already.

2. **Upload Dataset Files**: 
   - Navigate to the Databricks workspace.
   - Click on `Data` in the sidebar.
   - Select `Add Data` and then `Upload File`.
   - Upload the following dataset files to `/FileStore/tables/`:
     - `mutual.txt`
     - `business.csv`
     - `review.csv`
     - `user.csv`

3. **Create a New Notebook**: 
   - In your Databricks workspace, create a new notebook using existing .py files.
   - Select Python as the language.

4. **Load the Data**: Use Spark to load the dataset files from the `/FileStore/tables/` directory. Example code to load the datasets:
   ```python
    # Load required libraries
    from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
    
    # Create Spark session
    spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("Yelp Analysis").getOrCreate()
    
    # Load data
    business_df = spark.read.csv("/FileStore/tables/business.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)
    review_df = spark.read.csv("/FileStore/tables/review.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)
    user_df = spark.read.csv("/FileStore/tables/user.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)
    mutual_df = spark.read.text("/FileStore/tables/mutual.txt")

   ```

5. **Execute Each Task**: Open each of the provided .py files in a Databricks notebook or a separate editor. Run the scripts in the order you prefer. Each script processes the input data, performs necessary joins, calculations, and outputs the results as specified.
